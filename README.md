This repository contains Sorting Algorithms which are written in C++. This includes most of the run-time libraries and a custom header for each algorithm. The purpose of these algorithms is to to swap two numbers by using the mentioned algorithm. The algorithms being used are: **bubble sort**, which goes through an array, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Another algorithm , but is less efficient, is **insertion sort**. Numerous iterations are made, as the final sorted array is built one at a time. A third algorithm is **merge sort**, which cuts the array in half, sorts each half, and then will combine again at the end for a sorted array. Fourth is quick sort. **Quick sort**, similar to merge sort, divides the array, then recursively is called, and the result is a sorted array. Lastly, **selection sort** is an algorithm where the minimum value in an array is repeatedly found from an unsorted array, and that minimum value is moved to the start of the array.
